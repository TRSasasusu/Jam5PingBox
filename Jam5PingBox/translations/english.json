		"BOX1_INTRO": "This is a <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>miniature<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, or perhaps a diorama.",
		"BOX1_END_TEXT_TIMELOOP1": "PING: To verify that the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>time loop<![CDATA[</Color>]]> is functioning correctly, I tried visualizing the history from the previous loop. I'm pleased to confirm it's working perfectly.",
		"BOX1_END_TEXT_TIMELOOP2": "PING: I first experimented with this small miniature, but now I believe I can properly integrate it with the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]>. I'm truly excited about the possibilities.",
		"BOX1_END_PC": "Miniature 1 completion recorded.",
		"BOX2_INTRO_1": "PING: I found something interesting in the time loop data: meditation. If used properly, it might allow us to skip the idle time while waiting for interesting phenomena to occur.",
		"BOX2_INTRO_2": "PING: Update: I tried it and it's quite useful! If I ever meet a traveler who doesn't know about meditation, perhaps I should teach them?",
		"BOX2_END_TEXT_MEDITATION1": "PING: Notable discovery: I've learned an interesting property of meditation. Since it involves intentionally letting go of consciousness, the history recording seems to stop before vision is completely obscured.",
		"BOX2_END_TEXT_MEDITATION2": "PING: ...I'm not sure what this could be used for yet.",
		"BOX2_END_PC": "Miniature 2 completion recorded.",
		"BOX3_END_TEXT_DIORAMA1": "PING: With the Jam, I can manipulate both time and space (within limits). This miniature world was created using that ability. However, that's not the Jam's true essence—these are merely secondary effects.",
		"BOX3_END_TEXT_DIORAMA2": "PING: I should create a diorama looking back at those scenes from long ago. I want to remember that I was indeed Nomai. Besides... there are limits to the puzzles I can create with imagination alone.",
		"BOX3_END_TEXT_DIORAMA3": "PING: In that diorama, I plan to make spacesuits reproducible as well... but I wonder how much I can actually record. Perhaps even the camera device that separates from the spacesuit can be preserved in the history.",
		"BOX3_END_PC": "Miniature 3 completion recorded.",

		"BOXT_INTRO_1": "NEEM: What a <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>miniature<![CDATA[</Color>]]> star system! I never expected the gaps between suns to be this small. While I barely avoided warping directly into a sun, this is still a crash landing.",
		"BOXT_INTRO_2": "NEEM: I intended to stop for supplies before meeting up with Canna, but visiting this <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Bright Spark System<![CDATA[</Color>]]> was a mistake.",
		"BOXT_INTRO_3": "MELIA: The toxic liquid flooding into our Vessel was also unexpected. However, all crew members evacuated safely, we salvaged useful tools, and the warp core survived intact! It's not all bad news.",
		"BOXT_INTRO_4": "PING: I hastily grabbed some plants too, but it seems this white tree is somehow providing oxygen for the entire system. What a powerful tree!",
		"BOXT_INTRO_5": "NEEM: Addendum: The sky is covered with sparks, but they don't seem to cause electrical damage when touched. However, they form a solid membrane—fly too high and you'll hit your head. To escape, we'll need to fix the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Vessel<![CDATA[</Color>]]> somehow.",

		"BOXT_WARP_1": "SAPIN: This is troublesome... The crash impact caused the Vessel's internal warp activation panel to fall into the water. While I can generate the singularity here...",
		"BOXT_WARP_2": "DIDY: Can't we shoot something from above the water to activate the panel without direct contact?",
		"BOXT_WARP_3": "SAPIN: It wasn't designed that way. This was created when our ancestors visited a system where they were attacked by hostile robots, so they built it so those machines couldn't activate it.",
		"BOXT_WARP_4": "SAPIN: More specifically, this panel can only be activated by an organic lifeform connected to some Nomai computer. It wasn't designed exclusively for Nomai, but so far, only Nomai have ever used it...",
		"BOXT_WARP_5": "PING: Then I'll dive down. I've hastily built a detoxification function into my spacesuit.",
		"BOXT_WARP_6": "NEEM: That's too dangerous! That function hasn't been field-tested enough! Please let us conduct more testing and improvements first, Ping.",
		"BOXT_WARP_7": "PING: No, we're out of time and you know it, Neem. This system's suns will go supernova soon. All three of them! I want to repair the Vessel quickly and observe this rare triple supernova. So I'm going down.",

		"BOXT_SYMBOL_1": "PING: I saw this through the gaps in the rocks and couldn't help but come... What is this? Three symbols connected to something. Compared to the three abstract ones, this central symbol is clearly more concrete.",
		"BOXT_SYMBOL_2": "PING: ...<![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]>? Ah, once I see it that way, I can't see it as anything else.",
		"BOXT_SYMBOL_3": "PING: Setting aside what <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]> means, looking at the three symbols, only the triangular one appears emphasized. What does this signify...?",
		"BOXT_SYMBOL_4": "PING: This layout resembles this star system's structure. The three symbols each represent a sun, with <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]> at the center. Perhaps it's supplying energy.",
		"BOXT_SYMBOL_5": "PING: ...Still, to think there are places left to explore in this dying universe. I've heard my ancestors' exciting exploration records since childhood, but in this era, there were only dead stars and meaningless debris of broken asteroids. ...Ah, this is truly delightful.",
		"BOXT_SYMBOL_6": "PING: Wait, the detoxification function is failing! Good thing I can repair it here... Oh, this space seems to have lower toxicity, that's why I survived... Maybe it's related to the tree directly above.",

		"BOXT_TOWER_ANOTHER_1": "NEEM: We plan to meet up with Canna. She'll send an official message soon for everyone to gather at the Dark Rock System. We're making a detour to the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Bright Spark System<![CDATA[</Color>]]> for supplies beforehand. What are your plans?",
		"BOXT_TOWER_ANOTHER_2": "MIACEAE: Hmm... We plan to remain in our current system a while longer. We're actually conducting experiments to extend our sun's lifespan, centered around Cedrus. We're not sure if it'll work, but we've <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>built a clock tower<![CDATA[</Color>]]> and are conducting final tests, so please wait a bit longer.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_ANOTHER_3": "NEEM: How fascinating! I have no intention of rushing you, so please don't worry about that. The Nomai were originally nomadic, so I never expected all clans to agree to this gathering anyway.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_ANOTHER_4": "MIACEAE: That's helpful. Regardless of the results, I plan to bring our findings to the future <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>festival<![CDATA[</Color>]]>. I think we'll at least meet there in person, Neem.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_ANOTHER_5": "NEEM: That's good to hear. ...Many stars have become unstable recently. My clan will be careful, and you should be too.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_ANOTHER_6": "MIACEAE: Yes, likewise. See you later!",

		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_1": "NEEM: I have no memory of this conversation! And what is this building?! It's clearly built with panels from my clan, but I have no memory of constructing this!",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_2": "MELIA: Calm down, Neem. I understand your shock, though. This is definitely very eerie.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_3": "PING: If Miaceae's clan is conducting such experiments, that would be fascinating... I'll check with the Vessel's communication device later.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_4": "NEEM: ...Ah, sorry. I lost my composure. Now, what could explain this phenomenon? First hypothesis: a completely fictional story created by this system's devices.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_5": "MELIA: That's possible. When we arrived in this system, it might have read our memories and constructed this on the spot.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_6": "DIDY: But this building was here when we scanned just before arrival. That's how our Vessel avoided crashing into it.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_7": "NEEM: I see... Another possibility—though unlikely and seemingly absurd—I'll mention it anyway. Second hypothesis: brought from another parallel universe by this system's devices.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_8": "PING: Such a thing is possible?! If so, we could explore endlessly!",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_9": "NEEM: I only mentioned it as a possibility, so don't get your hopes up. Besides, even if true, there would be a price. For instance, it might sacrifice this system's three suns. Indeed, they appear to be absorbing something from the suns.",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_10": "PING: Ah, what's being collected is the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]>... What I saw in that gap near the Vessel's panels—is that what this means...?",
		"BOXT_TOWER_NOW_11": "MELIA: In any case, let's return to the Vessel. SAPIN and the others want to explain their analysis results. Plus, as Ping mentioned, we can check with Miaceae using the Vessel's communication device.",

		"BOXT_VESSEL_1": "SAPIN: I'll share the Vessel computer's analysis results. Focusing on the geology here, it appears the toxic liquid spread quite recently. Something abnormal is happening in this system.",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_2": "TURR: So we focused on the suns. Some device is drawing energy from them, but since these suns have short lifespans, the energy balance seems disrupted.",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_3": "TURR: If we send objects into these suns, the energy will stabilize, the liquid will recede, and the Vessel can be repaired.",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_4": "NEEM: Can we throw any objects into all three suns?",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_5": "TURR: Apparently not. Putting in too much would also disrupt the balance. Our simulations show that two suns need small lantern-sized objects. However...",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_6": "TURR: ...one sun requires an organic lifeform. We searched for alternatives but haven't found any yet. I apologize.",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_7": "NEEM: ...Would any plant work? We have several aboard the Vessel, right?",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_8": "SAPIN: Turr, you've been outmaneuvered. That solves it.",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_9": "TURR: The organic lifeform issue is resolved, but we must also be careful about the sequence. It's difficult to explain, but it seems to match the order of panels pressed to enter the Nomai structure behind us. Also, we still don't know which sun requires the organic lifeform.",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_10": "NEEM: Ah, I already know that. Ping told me earlier which sun receives special treatment. It was represented in symbols. Now, let's begin the escape procedure!",

		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_1": "PING: Miaceae, can you hear me? This is Ping from Neem's clan. I have something to ask...",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_2": "MIACEAE: Ah, I can hear you. Ping, it's been a while. How are you doing?",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_3": "PING: Fine... but our suns are about to explode, so I'll be brief. Have you been researching stellar lifespans recently?",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_4": "MIACEAE: Such an emergency?! Well, we intended to try it in a system we visited recently, but it went supernova first, so it's just an idea now. Sorry...",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_5": "PING: Don't worry about the suns. Our warp core is intact and we have an escape plan. More importantly, <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>did you build a clock tower<![CDATA[</Color>]]>?",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_6": "MIACEAE: A clock tower?! ...I see, that would have worked... No, our measurements failed, so we couldn't beat the supernova, but that's a good idea... Cedrus would be interested in that.",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_7": "PING: As I thought... That possibility is correct then...? ...Thank you, Miaceae. See you sometime!",
		"BOXT_VESSEL_BOARD_8": "MIACEAE: Ah, yes. I hope we'll meet again at a festival or something.",

		"BOXT_JAM_1": "PING: This is... <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]>...",
		"BOXT_JAM_2": "NEEM: Ping, don't get any closer! It's clearly dangerous! Besides, the Vessel repairs are complete—we just need to board and escape!",
		"BOXT_JAM_3": "PING: You want me to let this slip away? A chance to bring still-living star systems from parallel universes? A chance for infinite exploration like our ancestors had?!",
		"BOXT_JAM_4": "NEEM: I understand your feelings completely. I too was thrilled hearing our ancestors' records. And like you, I despaired at this era's dying universe filled with dead stars and meaningless asteroid debris.",
		"BOXT_JAM_5": "NEEM: But I'm the leader of this clan. I must prioritize my companions' survival. I can't let you die so easily either.",
		"BOXT_JAM_6": "PING: ...Even so, I'm staying here. Using Nomai technology, I can improve energy efficiency and expand the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam's<![CDATA[</Color>]]> possibilities.",
		"BOXT_JAM_7": "NEEM: I understand the logic. The species that created these devices was still developing in areas other than <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]>. What you say is possible. But still...",
		"BOXT_JAM_8": "PING: Then let me do this: <![CDATA[<i>]]>I declare independence from Neem's clan as Ping's clan<![CDATA[</i>]]>.",
		"BOXT_JAM_9": "NEEM: I see. Then, following Nomai principles of non-interference with other clans, I can't argue strongly. Nomai clans have always branched off this way, each creating new technologies.",
		"BOXT_JAM_10": "NEEM: But promise me this: come to the festival. Please.",
		"BOXT_JAM_11": "PING: ...I'm not sure I can make the next one, but... I understand. Goodbye, Neem.",
		"BOXT_JAM_12": "NEEM: We'll meet again someday, Ping.",
		"BOXT_JAM_13": "........",
		"BOXT_JAM_14": "PING: Well, Neem's Vessel escaped safely. I've stabilized the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]> too. But the supernova is unavoidable. I want that supernova energy, so that's fine, but the problem is that my physical body will die. What to do?",
		"BOXT_JAM_15": "PING: Then... let me become one with the <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]>.",

		"PING_SHIP_1": "These are my memories. They might be from another universe, or creations, or perhaps not even real anymore—I can't tell.",
		"PING_SHIP_2": "That is the <![CDATA[<Color=lightblue>]]>Ash Twin Project<![CDATA[</Color>]]>. <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]> alone cannot escape a universe destined to die. But with this, within infinite loops, I can summon new parallel universes each time the sun dies.",
		"PING_SHIP_3": "Among those, I noticed your existence. Unlike me, who became one with <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]>, you must move your own feet to learn. Despite that, you possess curiosity that rivals mine. Too vast to be contained within that dying star system. I was delighted to find a kindred spirit.",
		"PING_SHIP_4": "That's why I called you. I gathered many explorable worlds—<![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>MODs<![CDATA[</Color>]]>—summoned infinitely from parallel universes, wanting to invite you there.",
		"PING_SHIP_5": "Come, let us explore the infinitely expanding <![CDATA[<Color=orange>]]>MOD Jam<![CDATA[</Color>]]> forever in this Outer Wilds world...!",
